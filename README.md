**Analyze the Death Age Difference of Right-Handers with Left-Handers**

The project attempts to examine the death age difference between right-handers and left-handers in the United States, utilizing the basic work of Gilbert and Wysock. The goal is to investigate the claims of early death for left-handers by determining if the difference in average age at death can be attributable simply to changing rates of left-handedness through time. 
 
The study uses age distribution data and a data analysis framework based on pandas and Bayesian statistics to explore the likelihood of dying at a specific age depending on reported hand preference. Using Bayesian approaches, the study hopes to account for uncertainty and create more robust predictions about the association between hand choice and mortality. The research intends to replicate and investigate any reported variations in the average age at death for right-handers and left-handers through thorough data processing and statistical analysis. The comparison includes two time periods, 1999 and 1992, allowing for the evaluation of prospective changes in death age inequalities over time. The findings of this study have significance for understanding the relationship between hand preference and mortality. The study aims to provide insights into whether left-handedness affects mortality outcomes or if other factors contribute to the observed patterns by employing rigorous statistical approaches and controlling for unknown variables.  
 
Finally, utilizing age distribution data, this project provides an in-depth examination of the mortality age difference between right-handers and left-handers in the United States. The combination of pandas and Bayesian statistics allows for a complete analysis, to clarify the association between hand preference and age at death and add to the current body of information on this fascinating subject. The findings have public health implications and call into question prior claims of early death for left-handers, giving light on the complex connection between hand preference and mortality outcomes. 

** METHODOLOGY **

Data analysis is the collecting, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make forecasts for the future, and make informed data-driven decisions. Data analysis consists of six steps. The project followed these steps to complete the objective: 
1. Ask or Specify Data Requirements
2. Prepare or Collect data
3. Clean and Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act or Report 

1. Ask  

Every data analysis is performed to address a problem. However, you cannot select an appropriate model until you first understand the problem. As a result, the initial phase of data analysis begins with asking the appropriate set of questions to identify the problem. Defining your goal is mostly concerned with soft skills, business knowledge, and lateral thinking. However, you must also maintain track of company measurements and key performance indicators (KPIs).  
This project aims to investigate the claim of early death for left-handers compared to right-handers by analyzing age distribution data. The study uses pandas and Bayesian statistics to see if any difference in average age at death between the two groups can be attributed solely to changing rates of left-handedness over time, providing insights that either challenge or support the claimed association between hand preference and mortality.  

2. Prepare 

The second step is to Prepare or Collect the Data. This step includes collecting data and storing it for further analysis. The Prepare phase of data analytics is crucial in any project because it establishes the groundwork for subsequent analysis. Data collection for this project, which aims to investigate the potential relationship between hand preference and mortality using age distribution data, entails obtaining two primary datasets: death distribution data for the United States from 1999 obtained from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) and rates of left-handedness digitized from a figure presented in a 1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki. 
 
3. Clean and Process 

Process is the third step. After gathering data from various sources, it is time to clean the data. Clean data is data that is free of misspellings, repetitions, and irrelevant information. Data integrity is crucial to clean data.  Among the most important data-cleaning tasks are: 
• Removing major errors, duplicates, and outliers—all of which are inevitable problems when aggregating data from numerous sources. • Removing unwanted data points—extracting irrelevant observations that have no bearing on your intended analysis. • Bringing structure to your data—general ‘housekeeping’, i.e., fixing typos or layout issues, which will help you map and manipulate your data more easily. • Filling in major gaps—as you’re tidying up, you might notice that important data are missing. Once you’ve identified gaps, you can go about filling them. 
 
4. Analyze 
 
The Analyze step of data analytics involves processing and exploring the obtained data with a variety of tools and techniques in order to generate useful insights and draw conclusions. In this project, the Analyze phase utilizes several Python packages, including pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, to perform data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. These Python packages collaborate to process and analyze death distribution statistics and left-handedness rates. We can use statistical methods to investigate age-specific mortality rates, compare the average age at death between right-handers and left-handers, and assess the significance of any detected differences. The use of pandas, matplotlib, and numpy allowed us to get useful insights from data, supporting the project's goal of rejecting or validating the claim of early death for left-handed people based on changing rates of left-handedness over time. 
 
 5. Share  

The transformed data must now be visualized (chart, graph). The purpose of creating data visualizations is that there may be non-technical persons, primarily stakeholders. Visualizations are created to help people grasp complex facts in a straightforward way. Matplotlib is a well-known Python data visualization package. Matplotlib is used in the analyze phase to construct various plots, charts, and graphs to visually investigate the relationships and patterns within the data.  We can use visualizations to uncover trends, anomalies, and potential insights in data. 

6. Act or Report 

This is the final step of the data analytics process where the analysis decision is summarized and the result or consequences of the analysis process are represented in terms of story, report, recommendations, and PPT, tableau and SAS application plays an important role in summarizing the analysis process via a report or story building.
